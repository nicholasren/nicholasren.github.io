### Functor

#### Concept
Functor is a _type class_ that defines how to apply a function to a value wrapped in a context.`List`, `Option`, `Ethier`, `Try` both are functor.

{% highlight scala%}
trait Functor[A] {
  def map[B](f: A => B): Functor[B]
}
{% endhighlight%}

#### Functor laws:

- `map id = id`

   if we map the `id` function over a functor, the functor that we get back should be the same as the original functor
- for any functor F, the following should hold: `fmap (f . g) F = fmap f (fmap g F)`

  composing two functions and then mapping the resulting function over a functor should be the same as first mapping one function over the functor and then mapping the other one

#### Function is Functor:
###### Function composition:
Mapping a Function over a Function will produce a new Function(function composition), just like mapping a function over a `List` will produce a `List`, mapping a function over a `Option` will produce a `Option`.

###### Lifting:
Given a `map` function with type `(A => B) => F[A] => F[B]`(`F` is a functor, it could be `List`, `Option`, or `Ethier`), we can think the `map` as a function which take a function (with type `A => B`) as parameter and return a new function just like the old one(with type `F[A] => F[B]`).

### Applicative

#### Concept
Applicative is a _type class_ that defines how to apply a function wrapped in a context to a value wrapped in a context.
{% highlight scala%}
trait Applicative[A] extends Functor{
  def unit(a: A): Applicative[A]
  //TODO this may not be the right name
  def bind[B](f: Applicative[A=>B]): Applicative[B] 
}
{% endhighlight%}

### Monad

####Concept
Monad  is a _type class_  that defines how to apply a function that returns a wrapped value to a wrapped value.
{% highlight scala%}
trait Monad[A] extends Applicative{
  def flatMap[B](f: A => Monad[B]): Monad[B] // f is called monadic function
}
{% endhighlight%}

####Monad law

- Left identity

 Given a value `x` and a function `f`, the following should hold `unit(x) flatMap f = f(x)`

- Right identity

 Given a monad `m`, the following should hold ` m flatMap unit = m`

- Associativity

Given a monad `m` and two functions `f` and `g`, the following should hold:
`m flatMap f flatMap g == m flatMap g flatMap f`

__Problme monad want to solve:__

__if we have a fancy value and a function that takes a normal value but returns a fancy value, how do we feed that fancy value into the function?__
